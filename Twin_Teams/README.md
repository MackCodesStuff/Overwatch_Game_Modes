In this gamemode is relatively straightforward:
- The players are in slots 0-4, for a total of 5 players on each team.
- Each slot will always have the same character. 
- At the start of the game, everyone selects a character as normal.
- When the doors open *(all of the doors)* the game will randomly select one of the two heroes for each slot and force both players to be that hero.
- On death, excluding self-inflicted, each player will be allowed to select a new character. This will force their corresponding enemy to switch.
    - On a voluntary switch, the normal things will happen: Max of 25% ult charge.
    - On an involuntary switch, the player will retain the same percentage of health (+1, to avoid potentially dying from the switch) and retain 80% of their ult charge.
- There is no increased respawn time for overtime.
